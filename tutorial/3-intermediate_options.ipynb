    "# Truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "In applications of linear algebra, often one have to compute the truncated SVD of some matrix. By truncating we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem, which leads to lots of speed up for the upcoming algorithms. On the other hand, we lost information after the truncation. Ideally, we want to truncate as much as possible without losing the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be made for tensors, but in this context we use the [multilinear singular value decomposition](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/s0895479896305696) (MLSVD). If $T$ is a $L$-order tensor, then its MLSVD is written as $T = (U_1, \\ldots, U_L) \\cdot S$, where each $U_l$ is a orthogonal matrix and $S$ is a tensor with the same shape as $T$ (we consider $S$ as the *compressed* version of $T$). For the interested people, the notation used stands for the [multilinear multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_multiplication). This tensor $S$ is called the *central tensor* and it is the analogous of $\\Sigma$ in the classical SVD of the form $A = U \\Sigma V^T$. Note that we've said that $S$ is of the same shape as $T$, and just as in the 2D linear algebra, this is the *full* MLSVD, in contrast to the *reduced* MLSVD. In the same way we can consider the reduced SVD $A = U \\Sigma V^T$ where $\\Sigma$ is $R \\times R$ (and $R$ is the rank of $A$), we can have $S$ of shape $R_1 \\times R_2 \\times \\ldots \\times R_L$. The tuple $(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_L)$ is the *multilinear rank* of $T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first all we have is the full MLSVD, by Tensor Fox works the truncation for you at your taste. More precisely, you can tell the program if you want to truncate \"a lot\", \"just a few\", not truncate at all, etc. You can even tell the program to not compute the MLSVD and work with the original tensor (I do not advise to do that!). You communicate the program your type of truncation in the means of *levels*, where low levels translates to truncate a large amount and large levels translate to truncate small ammounts. Below we summarize the possible options you have (at the moment these only applies to third order tensors).\n",
    "\n",
    " - *level* $=0$: the conditions to truncate are very loose, so it is \"easy\" to truncate. This level causes very large truncations, which speeds uo the program at a cost of losing too much information of the original tensor.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *level* $=1$ (default): the conditions to truncation are median and reasonable. \n",
    " \n",
    " - *level* $=2$: the conditions to truncate are more tight but still manageable. Some tensors require this kind of truncation where you just cut off a little piece of the central tensor.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *level* $=3$: the conditions to truncate are extremely tight. This is almost as saying you don't want to truncate anything.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *level* $=4$: you want to work with the tensor $S$ of the full MLSVD, which has the same shape of $T$.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *level* $=5$: you want to work with the original tensor $T$. In this case the MLSVD is not computed.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you are working with tensor with order higher than $3$, then you can pass *level* as a list with two level values. The first one works the truncation of the original high order tensor. The second one works the truncations of the third order tensors of the CPD tensor train associated to the original tensor (see next lesson). If you set *level* to a single value, the program assumes you want to use this value for all both high order and third order tensors. Finally, we want to mention that you can also use the parameter *trunc_dims* to tell the program the exactly truncation you want to use. Just set this parameter to be a list of the dimensions you want (default is *trunc_dims = 0*, which lets the program to decide the best truncation). If you are work with tensors with order higher than $3$, this parameter refers to the original high order tensor only. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example we are working it is possible to note that the program is unable to truncate. Still, we can force some truncation, say $2 \\times 1 \\times 1$, and see if we get good precision of this. The precision can already be antecipated just by seeing the relative error of the compression (remember that this requires setting *display* to $3$, which can be costly), that is, the line\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compression relative error = 0.130828\n",
    "\n",
    "That line says this is the best precision we can get. This is because this is the error of the truncated $S$ and $T$, and all the iterations to be made will try to obtain a CPD for $S$."

    "\n",
    "The iteration process needs a starting point for iterating. This starting point depends on the *init_method* option, and there are three possible choices in this case: *smart*, *smart_random*, *random* (default), and *user*. Both *smart* and *smart_random* options generates a CPD of rank $r$ with a strategy relying on the MLSVD. The strategy *smart* maximizes the energy of the initialization wheareas *smart random* makes almost the same, but with a chance to take some different entries. These strategies generates starting points with small relative error, so it is already close to the objective tensor. Although this seems to be a good thing, there is also a risk to be close to a local minimum or saddle point, and in this cases these methods will always fail. The *random* is more robust, this option generates a CPD of rank $r$ with entries drawn from the normal distribution. The relative error in this case usually is close to $1$. Finally, there is the 'user' option where the user provides a list $[X, Y, Z]$ as starting point. This is a good idea when we already have a close CPD and want to increase its precision."

This option makes the program runs the algorithm two times, where the second run uses the approximated CPD computed in the first run as starting point.

Ideally, we want to compress and limit ourselves to the compressed version of $T$, but if this is not enough, the *refine* option can squeeze more precision at a cost of working with uncompressed tensors.

At each iteration the damping parameter is updated following a certain rule, and the user doesn't have influence over this. On the other hand, the user can choose the initial damping parameter factor. More precisely, the first damping parameter is $\\mu = \\tau \\cdot E[T]$, where $\\tau$ is the damping parameter factor and $E[T]$ is the mean of the values of $T$ (if there is compression, use $S$ instead of $T$). The default value we use is $\\tau = 1$, but the user can change it with the parameter *init_damp*. Experience shows that this value has little influence on the overall process, but sometimes it has a noticeable influence, so be aware of that.   "
