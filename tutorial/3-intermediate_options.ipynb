    "# Truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "In several applications of linear algebra, often one have to compute the truncated SVD of some matrix. By truncating we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem, which leads to lots of speed up. On the other hand, we lost information after the truncation. Ideally, we want to truncate as much as possible while maintaining the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be made for tensors, but in this context we use the [multilinear singular value decomposition](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/s0895479896305696) (MLSVD). If $T$ is a $L$-order tensor, then its MLSVD is written as $T = (U_1, \\ldots, U_L) \\cdot S$, where each $U_l$ is a orthogonal matrix and $S$ is a tensor with the same shape as $T$ (we consider $S$ as the *compressed* version of $T$). The notation used stands for the [multilinear multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_multiplication) brtween the $L$-tuple and the tensor $S$. This tensor $S$ is called the *central tensor* and it is the analogous of $\\Sigma$ in the classical SVD of the form $A = U \\Sigma V^T$. Note that we've said that $S$ is of the same shape as $T$, and just as in the 2D linear algebra, this is the *full* MLSVD, in contrast to the *reduced* MLSVD. In the same way we can consider the reduced SVD $A = U \\Sigma V^T$ where $\\Sigma$ is $R \\times R$ (and $R$ is the rank of $A$), we can have $S$ of shape $R_1 \\times R_2 \\times \\ldots \\times R_L$. The tuple $(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_L)$ is the *multilinear rank* of $T$. \n",

The first one works for the truncation of the original high order tensor. The second one works for the truncations of the associated tensor train third order CPD's (see next lesson). If you set $\\verb|tol| \\_ \\verb|mlsvd|$ to a single value, the program assumes you want to use this value for both high order and third order tensors. Finally, we want to mention that you can also use the parameter $\\verb|trunc| \\_ \\verb|dims|$ to tell the program the exactly truncation you want to use. Just set this parameter to be a list of the dimensions you want (default is $\\verb|trunc| \\_ \\verb|dims| = 0$, which lets the program to decide the best truncation). If you are work with tensors with order higher than $3$, this parameter refers to the original high order tensor only. \n",

    "In the example we are working it is possible to note that the program is unable to truncate. Still, we can force some truncation, say $2 \\times 1 \\times 1$, and see if we get good precision of this.

    "The iteration process needs a starting point for iterating. This starting point depends on the $\\verb|initialization|$ option, and there are three possible choices in this case: $\\verb|smart|, \\ \\verb|smart| \\_ \\verb|random|, \\ \\verb|random|$ and $\\verb|user|$. Both $\\verb|smart|$ and $\\verb|smart| \\_ \\verb|random|$ options generates a CPD of rank $R$ with a strategy relying on the MLSVD. The strategy $\\verb|smart|$ maximizes the energy of the initialization wheareas $\\verb|smart| \\_ \\verb|random|$ makes almost the same, but with a chance to take some different entries. These strategies generates starting points with small relative error, so it is already close to the objective tensor. Although this seems to be a good thing, there is also a risk to be close to a local minimum or saddle point, and in this cases these methods will always fail. The $\\verb|random|$ is more robust, this option generates a CPD of rank $R$ with entries drawn from the normal distribution. The relative error in this case usually is close to $1$. Finally, there is the $\\verb|user|$ option where the user provides a list $[X, Y, Z]$ as starting point. This is a good idea when we already have a close CPD and want to increase its precision."

This process can be done automatically by setting $\\verb|refine|$ to True. This option makes the program runs the algorithm two times, where the second run uses the approximated CPD computed in the first run as starting point. However, this second run is made in the original space (the space of the tensor $T$).

At each iteration the damping parameter is updated following a certain rule, and the user doesn't have influence over this. On the other hand, the user can choose the initial damping parameter factor. More precisely, the first damping parameter is $\\mu = \\tau \\cdot E[T]$, where $\\tau$ is the damping parameter factor and $E[T]$ is the mean of the values of $T$ (if there is compression, use $S$ instead of $T$). The default value we use is $\\tau = 1$, but the user can change it with the parameter $\\verb|init| \\_ \\verb|damp|$. Experience shows that this value has little influence on the overall process, but sometimes it has a noticeable influence, so be aware of that. Finally, we remark that it is possible to pass the parameter $\\verb|init| \\_ \\verb|damp|$ as a list of values, such that $\\verb|init| \\_ \\verb|damp|[k]$ will be the damping parameter used at $k$-th iteration.
