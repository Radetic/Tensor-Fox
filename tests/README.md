Test tensors
============

These tensors are a part of another work in which we made benchmarks to compare TensorFox 
and other programs with some implementation of the CPD. If one want to make some changes
in the code it could be a good idea to test how the original code performs with these 
tensors and them compare it with the tests after the changes.
