# Tests description

In this folder you will find the following tensors as Numpy files:

    border_rank.npy
    handwritten.npy
    swimmer.npy

Those three tensors are described at the main [README](https://github.com/felipebottega/Tensor-Fox/blob/master/README.md) of Tensor Fox. The tensor of matrix multiplication can be generated with the script `Mntensor.py`. The Tensor Fox's benchmarks showed in the [README](https://github.com/felipebottega/Tensor-Fox/blob/master/README.md) can be reproduced by following the steps of the notebook `make_tests.ipynb`. To compare it to other solvers use the script `matlab_benchs.m`.

Benchmarks with Gaussian mixture can be reproduced by following the notebook `gaussian_mix.ipynb` and the script `matlab_mix_benchs.m`.
